# Yassir Technical Challenge

So in order to make the code more "elegant" and "clean", i've installed different libraries:

- axios to make http request easier with promise support
- http-errors for better error handling

I have separated also the logic to smaller services, instead of throw it all inside the handler function.
Further optimisation i've could think of is to create a `pokemon` folder, move all the services/ models/ handler (controller) inside to seperate our `pokemon` domain, unit tests for the service i've created, api documentation with swagger üòÅ
